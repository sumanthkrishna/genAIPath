        "\n",
        "In the realm of data science, one of the critical stages of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is data cleaning. This process involves identifying and rectifying issues within the dataset, ensuring its quality and reliability for subsequent analysis. A fundamental aspect of data cleaning is understanding and handling different variable types appropriately. Variables can be broadly categorized into numerical and categorical types, each requiring distinct methods of cleaning and preprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Numerical Variables:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Numerical variables represent measurable quantities and can further be classified into two subtypes: discrete and continuous.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1.1. Discrete Numerical Variables:**\n",
        "Discrete variables take distinct, separate values and are often counted in whole numbers. Examples include the count of items, number of people, etc.\n",

        "**Cleaning Steps:**\n",
        "- Check for missing values.\n",
        "- Handle outliers if present.\n",
